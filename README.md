# Java Console

Logging in Java is annoying, you need to implement toString all over the place, can't inspect object, ...
Logging in the browser is however very pleasant.

This library is trying to fix some of this by providing an API which somewhat mirrors the console object in JavaScript.

Reflections allow inspection of objects so why not use it to build a *good* logging system?
